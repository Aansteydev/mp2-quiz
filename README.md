# Milestone Project 2 - Retro Videogame Quiz

## About

My second milestone project is focused on gaming just like my first project but this time it is in the form of an interactive quiz which takes full advantage of HTML, CSS and Javascript to create an entertaining and well designed environment for gamers to test their knowledge against a series of seven questions from a pool of 21 so this means that the player has a good chance that they will be able to play the quiz multiple times without facing the same questions. The questions are displayed above four multiple choice answers, each having the requisite answer contained within the button and each question follows the theme of retro gaming.

## Aesthetics

The user will first be introduced to the quiz by a "Splash Screen" which will require the user to press a button to enter the quiz, this splash screen will be simplistic but effective and will just a coloured screen featuring a logo for the site and a button below said logo, once the start button is pressed a Javascript script will initalise and transform the screen to the quiz where the player will be greeted with a simple set up of a container that holds the quiz question, data below it that records how many correct or incorrect answers the player has made as well as a question counter and will be followed by four multiple choice answers below the player data. The background colour of the website is Black and the fonts used are Orbitron for the headings and questions and Roboto for the answers.
